This example fetches, parses and loads an open Human Geography textbook, and
uses it to ground responses about this topic.

### Query

> Why to people migrate?

### Rendered prompt

> You should behave as a teacher.
> Using only the following context, answer the question below:
> 
> Context: As people migrate or move to anew area, they bring their ideas,
> objects, and the like with them in a process call
> Most migrants move for better jobs, higher incomes, and better opportunities
> overall
> People move and they mix with other groups of people
> Even though people generally migrate to find/make a better life for themselves
> and for their families, the benefits and pitfalls of migration affect
> different countries and regions in very different ways
> Rural residents are more migratory than those in towns
> While geographers try to understand where people move and why, a more
> significant question might be why so many people move
> Regardless of the time period, modern humans have been on the move for a very
> long timeâ€”a trend that has accelerated in recent years owing to cheap
> transportation and easier access to information by potential migrants
> Different people can have different adaptations to similar places
> 
> why do people migrate?

### Output (e.g.)

> People migrate for better jobs, higher incomes, and better opportunities
> overall.
